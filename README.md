# fluxCal
Working repository for spectral flux calibrations and tools for optical and near-IR  astronomy.

Optical here means ground-based optical and near-infrared, roughly 0.3 to 1.6-microns covered
by the LBT MODS and LUCI spectrographs, but it is built to be generally applicable.

Not a lot here yet, but will start growing soon.

## Projects

### Atmospheric Extinction

Codes for computing atmospheric extinction models, including
 * Rayleigh scattering
 * Aerosol (Mie) scattering
 * Ozone (Huggins & Chappuis bands)

### Telluric correction

How to estimate telluric absorption from highly variable sources
like water vapor and molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) based on pre-computed
atmospheric model templates.
